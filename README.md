# React Chrome Extension Starter

This project is a starter template for building a Google Chrome extension using React and Vite.

## Features
- Manifest v3
- Popup UI built with React
- Background script
- Placeholder icons

## Getting Started

1. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will output the production files to the `dist` folder.

2. **Load the extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder

3. **Edit the popup UI**
   - Modify React code in `src/` as needed

## Development
- Run `npm run dev` to start Vite's dev server for fast React development.
- Build with `npm run build` before loading into Chrome.

## File Structure
- `public/manifest.json`: Chrome extension config
- `public/background.js`: Background script
- `src/`: React popup source code
- `public/icon*.png`: Extension icons (replace with your own)
